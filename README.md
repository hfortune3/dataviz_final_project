The following is a sample of products created during the _"Data Visualization and Reproducible Research"_ course.


## Project 01

In the `project_01/` folder you can find an analysis of rat sightings in New York City from 2015-2017. I added an additional visualization that created a scatterplot of all rat sightings by their coordinates which led to essential a map of New York City colored by borough. I am showing my favorite visualization which is a jitter geom that allows for a quick analysis of rat sightings to occur by borough based off of the location type such as vacant lot or mixed use building. 

**Sample data visualization:**

## Project 02

In this project, I explored the results of finishers of the Boston Marathon in 2017. I added an additional visualization of a violin plot to more accurately visualize statistics of finishers overall placement based on their gender. the sample visualization I included Find the code and report in the `project_02/` folder.

## Project 03

In this project, I explored a dataset that contained weather conditions of the Tampa airport for every single day of 2022. I also made a sentiment analysis using a dataframe that contained songs and lyrics of the topp 100 Billboard hits from 2015. It was an interesting obersvation to see that the bottom ten percent of the topp 100 songs all mostly had negative emotions associated with them according to the Bing lexicon.

### Moving Forward

<<<<<<< HEAD
I throughly enjoyed how to make appropriate and accurate data visualizations. Was especially interesting to learn all of the different ways the data can be visualized as each way can lead the end result to produce much different results. In the future, I hope to learn how to use spatial data and interactivity in plots in tandem to be able to show how time alone can change a location over time.
